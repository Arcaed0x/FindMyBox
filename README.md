# Find My Box
#### v: 1.0.0

You are the blue circle and the goal of the game is to find the red box.
Every time you find the red box your score increases! The source for this game is very easy to understand and can be modified easily!

The development of this game is using c++14 and SFML with Clang 4.0.1

I am going to add a title screen in the future to polish the game further.

__NOTE:__ Please change the path of the font to something appropriate for your System. I am running Arch Linux so it may vary. You will find this path in the constructor of the Player class.
